Suggestions for Next Steps
Ensure Basic Functionality:

Verify that all primary features are operational and free of critical bugs.

Optimize Hibernate ORM:

Configure Hibernate to automatically handle and fix MySQL database issues, ensuring smooth integration and data consistency.

Key Management:

Review and correct primary and secondary key configurations to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.

Generate Dummy Data:

Create scripts to automatically generate and populate the database with dummy users, businesses, and events. This will aid in testing and development.

Improve Code Portability:

Add comprehensive comments and documentation to the codebase to make it easier for other developers to understand and contribute.

Develop Additional HTML for Testing:

Create new HTML files to test different front-end layouts and components. This will help refine the user interface.

Enhance UX/UI:

Focus on developing a front end that adheres to good UX/UI practices. Ensure the user interface is intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing.

Additional Recommendations
Implement Automated Testing:
